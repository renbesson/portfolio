## Description
This repository keeps the source code of my profesional portfolio website.
It it sectorized in three parts: Header, hero, and content.


### Header
It contains the website's title (my name) plus the navigation links.

### Hero
It contains a beautful (questionable) picture of myself, a positive phrase, and a nice background image which colors match the website's colors.

### Content
Its contains a about me section which I tell more about my professional career (under contruction), Work portraits my recent web development projects, and Contact Me is pretty much self explanatory.
